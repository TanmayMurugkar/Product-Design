Product Design

Took the problem through design sprint to develop a concept,created a prototype, and brought concept through user testing and then prepared handoff of concept to engineering team.

Problem:
Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times.

Task was to build a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention (ie: rerouting).
